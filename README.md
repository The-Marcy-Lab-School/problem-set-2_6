# Unit 2 Lesson 6 Problem Set
## Introduction to JavaScript Objects 

### Directions

**For Coding Exercises:**

1. Run `npm install` from the root directory to load project dependencies.

2. Complete coding exercises in the `exercises.js` file in the `problems` directory.
    * `exercises.js` Where you will code your solutions
    * `exercises.test.js` Your test file
    * `README.md` The instructions and prompts for your exercises.
    * `index.html`
    
3. Test your code often by running `npm test` from the root directory. 

4. Check for style by running `eslint problems/exercises.js` in the terminal. If you get an error `eslint: command not found`, run `npm install -g eslint` first.

5. You are not done with your exercises until all tests pass and there are no eslint errors.

   **Note:** We have provided an `index.html` so that you can test and run your code in the browser and use Chrome Dev tools.

**For Short Responses:**
1. Write your responses directly in the `short-response.md` file. 
2. Record your answers without removing the original questions.
3. Use complete sentences and style appropriately with markdown. As you commit and push changes, you will see your rendered markdown on GitHub.
